              The below photos were taken during the manufacturing process of the Thunderbikes battery case, during personal practice, and the lower frame (also shown above). We used a combination of TIG for the aluminum on the lower frame and MIG for the steel battery case.

              <p>
              I was tasked with designing and implementing a liquid cooling system linking our pump, motor, and motor controller. As a result, I developed an energy-efficient cooling system that met the heat dissipation requirements for short but intense motorcycle races. I improved my technical skills by participating in all aspects of the design process: developing my CAD design and simulation abilities and machine shop skills, all of which apply to the design and prototyping requirements of a mechanical engineer.

              <p>
              I designed and implemented a multi-fan and filter cooling system tailored to the unique challenges of maintaining optimal temperatures in the lower battery module and interior bus bars. Utilizing a series of 12V computer fans, 3D-printed components, and spray foam, I created an effective dust and debris filter. This innovative solution ensured efficient cooling in hard-to-reach areas, demonstrating a resourceful approach to thermal management in high-performance systems.

              As the Cooling Lead, I guided my team in utilizing the UBC wind tunnel and anemometer to evaluate the radiator's efficiency and heat dissipation capacity across varying speeds. This analysis enabled us to identify the optimal airflow required for effective cooling and develop a supplementary fan system for low-speed operation. By integrating these insights, we optimized the thermal performance of our electric motorcycle, ensuring reliability and efficiency under diverse operating conditions.

              The project's current iteration has replaced the springs with linear actuators, allowing it to be reusable so long as the needle is replaced and providing greater control. Linear actuators also allow for a more compact solution and the ability to administer up to 3 doses of naloxone. Additionally, the injection sequence now begins when there is a drop of more than 4% oxygen saturation (SPO2) to account for errors and patients with abnormally low levels due to other health concerns. Furthermore, the device is now located on the thigh to account for potential movement. It increases the likelihood that the injection will hit a muscle as the quadricep is a more significant muscle than the deltoid.

The system integrates ultrasonic distance sensors with an Arduino-based controller and a Bluetooth display, all housed in a custom-designed, 3D-printed case using Bambu Lab technology. Advanced algorithms were created using MATLAB and Python to ensure accurate distance calculations while compensating for parallax, delivering a reliable and user-friendly parking solution.
